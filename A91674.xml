         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cartwright</hi> told <hi>Rebert Martine</hi> of another uproare he cauſed by blowing a horn, and cauſed ſtones to be thrown at our <hi>friends,</hi> and wiſhed they would drown themſelves; beſides our <hi>friend</hi> in the <hi>common Goale</hi> had ſtones thrown at him, ſpit at him, threw mans Dung in at him, ſome more filthy abuſes he had which is a ſhame to name; one idle Drunken man came with a <hi>Pike</hi> in his hand ſwearing and railing with ſo much violence, as though he would preſently have murdered him, mentioning knocking him on the head in the night, &amp; the <hi>Iuſtice</hi> were acquainted with him, and no Officer would meddle with him; neither did they at all, for he ſaid the beſt in the Town ſent him. On the ſixth day we had a meetieg in the Street, where our friend ſpake forth of the Priſon hole, at which time many threw dirt and ſtones at them, one friend told a Conſtable he was abuſed, the Conſtable told him he ſhould be more abuſed; on the firſt day following we appointed a meeting, where friends came to the Meeting, them called Juſtices, with other Officers, came, thruſt and forced away with VVeapons thoſe that harmed not any, as many of the Townes people as were at the meeting as they could get together they put in the Town Hal, <note place="margin">VVitneſs Iohn Prickt, Iacob Vnderhill.</note> four countrey men that came a foot to the Meeting they ſet in the Stocks, in which uproare <hi>Robert Martine</hi> did whoop again, to raiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther uproar, &amp; ſwore wounds, &amp; ſend for a lader preſently to put our friend in a dungeon, &amp; ſaid, there let him ly and be hang'd until lice eat him. And the ſame day one <hi>Baarat,</hi> that hath been in actual Arms againſt the preſent power all thſe wars, and was alſo at Worceſter fight laſt, that day did marry contrary to the Act, and hath ever contemned that Act, and married contrary to it, profeſſing to be a Miniſter; he is known by moſt to be a common drunkard and ſwearer, and a notorious vile perſon; yet he now ſits upon the Bench ſometimes with theſe called Juſtices, which is a great encouragement for evil doers. On the ſecond day there was a Proclamation by the Protector, againſt Swearers, Drunkards, and the like prophaneneſs, they onely read it, and denied the poſting it up, and took it away; a friend having got one of them they denied him the poſting of it up that day, the next day he poſted it up, but it was ſoon took down again; that proclamation they obſerve not at all; <note place="margin">Iohn Reed.</note> for though they ſee them drunk, and hear them ſwear, they reprove them not, though told them often; ſo Juſtice falls in the ſtreet, and oppreſſion is ſet up, and outragious perſecution; one of the Prieſts chief hearers ſaid, Chriſt had failings, and <hi>Iohn Ballis</hi> ſaid, So far as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpoke Scripture, he ſpoke Chriſts voice.
